# java-automation-framework [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/web-innovate/java-automation-framework.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/web-innovate/java-automation-framework)
An Automation framework that follows the Page Object Design Pattern.

What does this bring to the game ?

At the moment you will find here components that you could use right away inside into your own automation framework.


At the moment, I don't consider this being a ready to use framework as it only contains components.
In the near future we will add support to initialize the WebDriver instance based on a `config.json` file that will be served by you alone.
