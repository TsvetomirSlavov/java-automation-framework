An Automation framework that follows the Page Object Design Pattern.

What does this bring to the game ?

At the moment you will find here components that you could use right away inside into your own automation framework.


We don't consider this being a ready to use framework as it only contains components.
In the near future we will add support to initialize the WebDriver instance based on a `config.json` file that will be served by you alone.
